# SundayMovieSelector
A simple java program that can be used to add movie titles to a text file and also use the same text file to randomly choose a movie title. Made Specifically for Phi Delt Sunday Movie Nights.

In order to use this very simple program all you need to do is download the .exe file and save it in a folder so that it can create the "hat.txt" file and you are good to go.

If you need to update your JRE to run the program launch4j should prompt you to the update page.
