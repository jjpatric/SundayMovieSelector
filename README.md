# SundayMovieSelector
A simple java program that can be used to add movie titles to a text file and also use the same text file to randomly choose a movie title.
I used https://www.leepoint.net/JavaBasics/index.html as a guide for creating the simple window.
I used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashmap-treemap-java/ to learn how to use hashmaps in Java.
I used https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2013/05/how-to-generate-random-numbers-in-java-between-range.html to learn how to generate a random integer within a set range.
